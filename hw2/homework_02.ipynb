    "Using the [```fourDataSets.csv```](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/usfca-cs686-ml/hw2/fourDataSets.csv), regress $Y$ on $X$ for $i=1,2,3,4$, i.e., generate four separate SLR models. **For each** of the four data sets, run and report summary statistics, generate a scatter plot and run a SLR model, reporting the regression function $R^2$, $R_a^2$, and the significance of $b_1$ ($p$-value). Intelligently discuss what you observe about each data set and the data sets as a whole."
